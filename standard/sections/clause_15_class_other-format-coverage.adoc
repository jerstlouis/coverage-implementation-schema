== Class _other-format-coverage_

Class _other-format-coverage_ establishes how coverages are represented in encoding formats other than those defined in this standard.          Such formats may be able to encode only parts of a coverage (i.e., they are “informationally incomplete”), and they may be able to encode only specific categories of coverages (such as raster images, but not point clouds).
