== Annex : Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

This Annex specifies an Abstract Test Suite which shall be passed in completeness by any implementation claiming conformance with this Application Schema.The test approach conceptually consists of two steps:
* Transcode the coverage from its original format into one of the formats directly addressed by this standard[[_ftnref4]], following the mapping rules defined for the particular original format on hand[[_ftnref5]].
* Perform all conformance tests on this transcoded coverage representation. Tests fail/succeed if they fail/succeed, resp., on this transcoded representation.

A concrete test implementation may choose a different strategy (may be for efficiency reasons) as long as the tests behave as indicated in this Abstract Test Suite.

=== Conformance Test Class: _coverage_

|===
| Test Purpose: | Requirement 1

| *Test method:* a| Test the coverage under test:
* If the coverage passes the tests of CIS 1.1 core conformance class _coverage_ (disregarding this Requirement 2), pass test.
* Otherwise, if the coverage passes the tests of GMLCOV/CIS 1.0 core conformance class _gml-coverage_, pass test.
* Otherwise, if the coverage is a gridded coverage and it passes the tests of GMLCOV/CIS 1.0 core conformance class _gml-coverage_ with a grid structure as defined in GML 3.3, pass test.
* Otherwise, fail test.

|===


|===
| Test Purpose: | Requirement 2

| *Test method:* a| Determine the encoding of the coverage under test:

* If the encoding is GML, perform the conformance test defined for class _gml-coverage_.
* Otherwise, if the encoding is in some other format:


** Convert the coverage into one of the formats directly addressed by this CIS standard, according to the coverage mapping defined for the corresponding encoding standard;
** perform the conformance test defined of the resp. format;
** perform the conformance test defined for class _other-format-coverage_.
* Otherwise, fail test.
