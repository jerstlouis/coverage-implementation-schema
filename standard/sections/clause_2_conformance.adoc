== Conformance

This standard defines: coverages.

Standardization target of this document are concrete *coverage instance documents*, as generated by some service and/or consumed by some client.

This document contains requirements for the following standardization target types (cf. Figure 1).

*   The core class _coverage_ (in red). This is the only abstract class – it establishes the basic framework, while the concrete conformance classes listed below define how concrete coverage instances can be built.
*   The grid coverage classes (in green):
** Class _grid-regular_ establishes multi-dimensional unreferenced and regular referenced grids; in particular, GridCoverage and Rectified­Grid­Coverage are provided here for backwards compatibility with version 1.0 of this standard;
** Class _grid-irregular_ establishes multi-dimensional irregular referenced grids; and
** Class _grid-transformation_ establishes multi-dimensional referenced grids defined by algorithmic transformations.
*   The discrete coverage classes (in blue):
** Class _discrete-pointcloud_ establishes point clouds; and
** Class _discrete-mesh_ establishes general multi-dimensional meshes.
*   The format encoding classes (in yellow):
** Class _json-coverage_ establishes JSON encoding of coverages;
** Class _rdf-coverage_ establishes RDF encoding of coverages;
** Class _gml-coverage_ establishes GML encoding of coverages;
** Class _other-format-coverage_ establishes further encodings of coverages; and
** Class _multipart-coverage_ establishes a multipart encoding of coverages.
*   Class _coverage-partitioning_ (in grey) establishes coverages composed from several sub-coverages.
*   Class _container_ (in white) establishes a general object capable of holding coverages and any other structure.

NOTE: Classes _coverage_, _grid-regular_, _grid-irregular_, _grid-transformation_, _discrete-pointcloud_, and _discrete-mesh_ together establish the conceptual coverage implementation model whereas classes _gml-coverage_, _json-coverage_, _rdf-coverage_, _other-format-coverage_, _multipart-coverage_, and _coverage-partitioning_ establish encoding and representation schemes.

Figure 1 show the requirements class dependencies depicted as a UML package diagram: each package represents one class, the _depends-on_ relationship represents the OGC requirements class dependency relationship.

Conformance with this standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web sitefootnote:[www.opengeospatial.org/cite].

In order to conform to this OGC™ CIS interface standard, a software implementation *shall* choose to implement:

* the core class _coverage_ plus
* at least one of the discrete or grid coverage classes plus
* at least one of the encoding classes _json-coverage_, _gml-coverage_ and _other-format-coverage_.

Further classes can be implemented optionally as long as the dependencies set forth by this standard are respected.

Each requirements class in this standard corresponds to a single conformance class. Abstract conformance tests are listed in Annex A, whereby each test references back the requirement it assesses. Concrete implementations of these tests shall be exercised on any software artefact claiming to implement a conformance class of this standard.

Requirements and conformance tests are identified through URLs. Table 1 summarizes the respective URLs. As a rule, requirements and conformance class URLs defined in this document are relative to http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.1/[http://www.opengis.net/spec/CIS/1.1/].

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.
